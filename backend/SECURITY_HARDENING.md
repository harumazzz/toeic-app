## High Priority Security Improvements

### 1. TLS/SSL Configuration Enhancement
- [ ] Force HTTPS in production
- [ ] Implement proper SSL certificate management
- [ ] Add HSTS headers
- [ ] Configure secure cipher suites

### 2. Database Security Hardening
- [ ] Enable SSL for PostgreSQL connections
- [ ] Implement database connection encryption
- [ ] Add database audit logging
- [ ] Configure proper database user permissions

### 3. Container Security
- [ ] Run containers as non-root user
- [ ] Implement security scanning for Docker images
- [ ] Add resource limits
- [ ] Enable read-only root filesystem

### 4. API Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement API versioning security
- [ ] Add request size limits
- [ ] Implement GraphQL security (if applicable)
- [ ] Add API documentation security

### 5. Environment & Secrets Management
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management
- [ ] Environment variable encryption
- [ ] Secure configuration management
- [ ] Add secret rotation mechanisms

### 6. Monitoring & Incident Response
- [ ] Security event logging
- [ ] Intrusion detection
- [ ] Automated security scanning
- [ ] Security metrics dashboard

### 7. Additional Security Headers
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Feature Policy/Permissions Policy
- [ ] Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy
- [ ] Strict-Transport-Security

### 8. Input Validation & Sanitization
