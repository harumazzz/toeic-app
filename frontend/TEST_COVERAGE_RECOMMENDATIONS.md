# Test Coverage & Recommendations

This document summarizes the current test coverage in the `frontend/test` directory and provides
recommendations for missing tests. The recommendations are split into **Unit Tests** and
**Integration Tests** for clarity.

## Unit Tests

### Already Covered

-   **speaking**: domain/use_cases, domain/entities, data/model, data/repositories
-   **progress**: domain/use_cases, domain/entities, data/model
-   **grammars**: domain/use_cases, domain/entities, data/model
-   **exam**: domain/use_cases, domain/entities, data/model
-   **writing**: domain/usecases, domain/entities, domain/repositories, data/models
-   **vocabulary**: domain/usecases, domain/entities, data/models, data/data_sources,
    presentation/widgets (word_detail)
-   **auth**: All layers and widgets, including provider, repository, data source, model, and all
    screens/widgets
-   **vocabulary**: data/repositories, more presentation/widgets, error/edge cases
-   **grammars**: data/repositories, presentation/widgets, error/edge cases
-   **exam**: data/repositories, presentation/widgets, error/edge cases
-   **writing**: data/repositories, presentation/widgets, error/edge cases

### Should Be Added

-   **speaking**: presentation/widgets, domain/services (if any), error/edge cases
-   **progress**: data/repositories, presentation/widgets, error/edge cases
-   **Other features (home, settings, profile, help, loading, etc.)**: No unit tests foundâ€”add tests
    for domain, data, and presentation layers.

## Integration Tests

### Already Covered

-   No integration tests found. The `integration` folder is empty.

### Should Be Added

-   **speaking**: Integration tests for flows (e.g., starting/completing a speaking session)
-   **progress**: Integration tests for progress tracking and updates
-   **grammars**: Integration tests for grammar search and retrieval
-   **exam**: Integration tests for exam attempt flows
-   **writing**: Integration tests for writing prompt submission and evaluation
-   **vocabulary**: Integration tests for word lookup, addition, and learning flows
-   **auth**: _No missing integration tests (**FINISHED**)_
-   **Other features (home, settings, profile, help, loading, etc.)**: Add integration tests for
    main user flows

---

## General Recommendations

-   Add negative/edge case tests for error handling, security, and network failures.
-   Add end-to-end (E2E) or UI tests for critical user journeys.
-   Ensure all new features include both unit and integration tests.
